# UltraContextHybrid

## Overview
This repository hosts a conceptual paper by Rohith Garapati on a hybrid AI architecture combining a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a transformer model. The design enables efficient handling of ultra-long contexts, such as 2 million tokens or more, by using the RNN for compression and the transformer for local processing. Key features include high-dimensional representations (16,384 dims), mixed precision (FP8/FP4/ternary), and Grouped Query Attention (GQA) for scalability.

This is a theoretical blueprint—no code or experiments are included. It explores paths to advanced reasoning and super intelligence through efficient long-context modeling.

## Key Ideas
- **RNN Compression**: Processes sequences in 64-token chunks, compressing 2M tokens into ~31K high-dim vectors for linear-time efficiency.
- **Transformer Integration**: Uses cross-attention to query RNN outputs, with flexible windows (32K–131K tokens).
- **Efficiency Gains**: Claims 8,000× memory reduction and support for massive contexts.
